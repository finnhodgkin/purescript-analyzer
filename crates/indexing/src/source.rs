//! Enables offset-independent annotations
//!
//! Text ranges are often used to annotate syntax nodes with additional
//! information. However, they're unsuitable for tracking information
//! across non-semantic changes such as editing whitespace or comments.
//!
//! The syntax tree can be thought of as a combination of two pieces of
//! information, offsets and structures. Non-semantic edits will always
//! change the offsets but only semantic edits can change the structure.
//!
//! The [`Source`] provides offset-independent indices [`Idx`] which can
//! be used in place of text ranges [`AstPtr`]. These indices are solely
//! dependent on the structure bit of the syntax treeâ€”they're unaffected
//! by non-semantic edits in a source file.
//!
//! An incremental compiler such as this project takes advantage of this
//! property for caching. The information that it collects is entirely
//! dependent on the structure bit of a source file, eliminating most
//! cache misses arising from shifting offsets.
